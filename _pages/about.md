I am a passionate astrophysicist with a Ph.D. in Astrophysics from the University of Hong Kong. My research focuses on the study of accreting supermassive black holes. 

Throughout my academic career, I have developed a diverse set of skills that would be valuable in a variety of roles:
- Proficient in programming languages such as Python
- Extensive experience with data analysis and visualization tools (Jupyter Notebook)
- Strong background in statistical modelling and machine learning techniques
- Excellent written and verbal communication skills, with experience presenting research at conferences
- Skilled in project management and collaboration
- Familiar with scientific computing environments and High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems
- Staying up-to-date with the latest cutting-edge research in my field


In addition to my research, I enjoy sharing my knowledge through teaching, public outreach, and mentoring students.
