During Covid, I attended the biggest conference within astronomy, the "American Astronomical Society Meeting". Here I gave a contributed talk explaining my findings presented in the paper:  <a href="https://gfh112.github.io/Lars/publications/X-ray_reverberation" target="_blank">Relativistic X-Ray Reverberation from Super-Eddington Accretion Flow</a>.
