It was hypothesised a few decades ago that a star torn apart by the tidal force from a black hole would form an X-ray-emitting accretion disk. While Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have since been observed, the standard accretion disk model struggles to explain their diverse observational properties. A group of models, based on the idea of reprocessing, have emerged as a promising explanation. In such models, an extended envelope formed by the stellar debris absorbs the X-ray radiation from the inner accretion flow and re-emits in lower energies. In this talk, I will first review some recent advances in the models about reprocessing in TDEs. Then I will focus on discussing how the TDE emission properties can be linked to the properties of the super-Eddington accretion flow, such as the observer viewing angle and accretion rate, in which reprocessing naturally happens. I will also mention new modelling results on the observed spectroscopic properties of TDEs.
