Black holes are some of the most interesting astrophysical objects to study since they can be used to test our theories under the most extreme conditions. Such as two black holes colliding producing gravitational waves, how lights and particles move in curved space time, gravitational lenses and tidal disruption events. I focus on how black holes grow in size and mass due to gas accretion.
